# Man-Horse-Scripts
I plan for this to  be a repository of PowerShell scripts I have developed to shave milliseconds off of the time it takes me to do something at work.
They are all named for Horses who have raced in the Melbourne Cup.

## [Acrasia](./Acrasia/)
Edge Profile Managment and admin shortcuts.

## [Cross Counter](./CrossCounter/)
*Cross Counter* is for making fast changes to user profiles in a Microsoft 365 tenant with the MgGraph powershell module. 
At a glance:
 - Edit user profile information such as name/location/phone number/email etc.
 - Reset user passwords.
 - Edit users' M365 group memberships.
 - Make profile changes to *all* the users in a tenant at once.

## [HiJinx](./HiJinx/)
*HiJinx* rips account login data from Chromium browsers like Chrome and Edge.

## [Still in Development:](./Dev/)
