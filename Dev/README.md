# Dev Scripts
This folder is filled with stuff that falls into one of the following categories:
- Does not work
- Nothing more than little snippets or off-cuts of code
- Non-functional drafts of ideas for future scripts
- Stuff that is in-production, but not developed enough to warrant its own directory.
